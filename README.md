# circadran
As Ian Malcom said in Jurrassic Park: "Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should." This is an attempt to generate melodies using list processing in pure data. Soon to be refactored in Extempore. The generation system is based on David Cope's SPEAC system.

Dependencies: Pure Data libraries Cyclone and list-abs

Main patch: CIRCADRAN.pd
